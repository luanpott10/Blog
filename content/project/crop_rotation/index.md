Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of different types of crops in the same area across a sequence of growing seasons. It reduces reliance on one set of nutrients, pest and weed pressure, and the probability of developing resistant pest and weeds. Continuous crop in the same place for many years in a row, known as monocropping, gradually depletes the soil health and  selects for a highly competitive pest and weed community.

Our project aims to map crop rotation practices utilizing ground truth and remote sensing data.

For this project we have being utilized crop type classification model to extract crop type information of 4 growing seasons in a row for evaluate the crop rotation pattern in the different regions in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.
