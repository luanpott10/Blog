Crop type classification is essential for agricultural management and policy making for food security and sustainability. Automating crop classification process while elaborating a workflow is a key step for reliable and precise crop mapping.

Our project aims to develop a in-season crop type map for the main crops in Southern Brazil.

For this project we have being utilized data from Google Street View and ground truth data incorporation data fusion data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and SRTM data to develop a machine learning model to estimate crop area and generate crop type maps.
