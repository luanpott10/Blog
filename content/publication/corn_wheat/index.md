title: "Hairy vetch role to mitigate crop yield gap in different yield environments at field level"

abstract: "The spatial variability of soil organic matter, plant water availability, and soil nitrogen (N) availability are drivers of crop response to mineral N fertilizer. The complex interaction of these factors is responsible for within-field corn and wheat yield variability. The hairy vetch (HV) cover crop is an economic, environmentally friendly, and efficient N source capable of conciliating crop yield and soil health. Nevertheless, the HV effects to mitigate yield gap of management zone (MZ) have not yet been documented. This study evaluated the effects of HV 
and mineral N fertilization, in single or combined input, on alleviating crop yield gap. The study was carried out in two croplands southern Brazil. The experimental design was a complete  randomized block in a split plot having MZ (high, medium, and low yield) and N fertilizer rates. 
Wheat and corn N uptake and grain yield had a quadratic adjustment with N fertilizer input, but 
there was a significant MZ effect, where low yield zone (LYZ) was less responsive. Consequently, 
mineral N fertilization as a single input to mitigate the yield gap in this MZ was not efficient. On the other hand, HV increased corn N uptake and grain yield mainly in LYZ compared to MYZ and 
HYZ. HV fully mitigated the yield gap between MYZ and HYZ. The combined use of HV and mineral 
N fertilization rate adjusted according to N legume credit and MZ was an efficient strategy to 
boost yield, favoring soil health and environmental protection. "
