title: "Mitigation of soil compaction for boosting crop productivity at varying yield environments in southern Brazil"

abstract: "Soil compaction is one of the most relevant crop yield-limiting factors in no-till (NT) farming systems in southern Brazil. This study aimed to identify strategies to mitigate soil compaction and increase crop productivity at low, medium and high yield environments within a field. Treatments evaluated were: control (without intervention), PG (phosphogypsum), MC (mechanical chiselling), PCC (polyculture of cover crops), MC + PG, PCC + PG, MC + PCC and MC + PCC + PG. Soil physical and chemical attributes (soil macroporosity, bulk density, penetration resistance) and soybean yield (Glycine max L.) and black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb) biomass production were evaluated. In the low and medium yield environments, MC + PCC + PG promoted the highest soybean yields: 5,455 kg ha−1 and 5,534 kg ha−1, respectively. In the high yield environment, PCC + PG promoted the highest soybean yield (5,579 kg ha−1), whereas MC decreased yields relative to the control. Black oat biomass production responded to the treatments similarly to soybean yields. Overall, integrating two or three decompaction strategies improved soil physical attributes in a greater proportion relative to single strategies and to the control, enhancing both soybean and black oat performances. Selection of the right decompaction strategies for each yield environment might help increase productivity under NT and optimize the use of time, labour, fuel and other resources."

summary: "Soil compaction is one of the most relevant crop yield-limiting factors in no-till (NT) farming systems in southern Brazil. Soil compaction limits crop yields under no-tillage farming in southern Brazil. Soil decompaction strategies to increase soybean yields are specific to yield environments. "
