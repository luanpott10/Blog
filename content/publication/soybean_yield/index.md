title: "Satellite-based soybean yield forecast: Integrating machine learning and weather data for improving crop yield prediction in southern Brazil"

abstract: "Soybean yield predictions in Brazil are of great interest for market behavior, to drive governmental policies and to increase global food security. In Brazil soybean yield data generally demand various revisions through the following months after harvest suggesting that there is space for improving the accuracy and the time of yield predictions. This study presents a novel model to perform in-season (“near real-time”) soybean yield forecasts in southern Brazil using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Neural Networks, satellite imagery and weather data. The objectives of this study were to: (i) compare the performance of three different algorithms (multivariate OLS linear regression, random forest and LSTM neural networks) for forecasting soybean yield using NDVI, EVI, land surface temperature and precipitation as independent variables, and (ii) evaluate how early (during the soybean growing season) this method is able to forecast yield with reasonable accuracy. Satellite and weather data were masked using a non-crop-specific layer with field boundaries obtained from the Rural Environment Registry that is mandatory for all farmers in Brazil. Main outcomes from this study were: (i) soybean yield forecasts at municipality-scale with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.24 Mg ha−1 at DOY 64 (march 5) (ii) a superior performance of the LSTM neural networks relative to the other algorithms for all the forecast dates except DOY 16 where multivariate OLS linear regression provided the best performance, and (iii) model performance (e.g., MAE) for yield forecast decreased when predictions were performed earlier in the season, with MAE increasing from 0.24 Mg ha−1 to 0.42 Mg ha−1 (last values from OLS regression) when forecast timing changed from DOY 64 (March 5) to DOY 16 (January 6). This research portrays the benefits of integrating statistical techniques, remote sensing, weather to field survey data in order to perform more reliable in-season soybean yield forecasts."
