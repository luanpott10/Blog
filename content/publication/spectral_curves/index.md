title: "Spectral curves for identification of weeds in wheat crop"

abstract: "The principal weeds in wheat cultivation are black oats and ryegrass and their control is generally performed without considering the spatial variability of the density of weed infestation. One way to identify weed species is by analyzing spectral curves of the targets. The objective of this work was to evaluate the spectral curves of wheat, black oats and ryegrass to identify which wavelengths are able to distinguish these species. The experiment was set using the species: black oats, ryegrass and wheat. Each species was sown in individual experimental plots in a completely randomized design with nine replications. HandHeld 2, ASDÂ® spectroradiometer 
with 325-1075 nm spectral range was used to perform readings at full bloom stage. Then, the 
reflectance spectral data were grouped into eight spectral bands: violet, blue, green, yellow, 
orange, red, red edge and near infrared. Descriptive statistics of reflectance of the targets as well as analysis of variance (p<0.05) and test of Tukey for comparison of the means (p<0.01) were 
performed using the reflectance measurement of each spectral band. The results showed that 
the yellow and orange spectral bands obtained higher capacities of differentiation of the species 
under study. It can be concluded that the analysis of spectral curves of target of black oat and 
ryegrass weeds and wheat crop makes it possible to differentiate species in full bloom stage"
