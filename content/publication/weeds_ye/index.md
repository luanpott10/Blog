title: "Densidade de plantas daninhas sob intervenções em três distintas zonas de manejos"

abstract: "The presence of weeds in agricultural areas depends, among other factors, on the management system. The objective of this study was to evaluate weed infestation using different interventions in autumn winter carried out in three different management zones. The experiment was delimited in the different management zones, in a randomized block design with three replications. The treatments were distributed in factorial. Factor A tested the high, medium and low management zones; while factor B consisted of interventions for soil management: fallow, chiseling, polyculture and chiseling + polyculture. The weed counting was performed ten days before desiccation, by counting and identifying the species in an area of 1m2. There was no interaction between the factors tested, but the treatments showed differences between them when studied separately. The lowest weed densities occurred in the high management zone, and the intervention with the lowest weed density was scarification + polyculture. However, the use of practices such as scarification and mulching with polycultures is a way to reduce the weed density. "
